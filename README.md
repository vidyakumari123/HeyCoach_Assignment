# HeyCoach_Assignment

[Project Title: Restaurant Listing Platform]

Speed and Efficiency:
The time taken to complete the assignment will be considered in the evaluation.
Efficiency of the application is crucial for a seamless user experience. Efficient algorithms and optimized code will ensure quick response times and smooth user interactions.

UI Design:
The user interface will be developed using Material-UI design components or any other preferred UI libraries. The design will be modern, intuitive, and user-friendly, ensuring a clean and professional user interface for the platform.

API Calls:
Axios will be used to make API calls to the backend (Node.js server) for performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the restaurants. This will ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend, maintaining data consistency and accuracy.

Model Structure:
Database models will be designed and structured efficiently for storing restaurant information. Proper normalization and indexing will be applied to optimize database queries and minimize response times. The models will facilitate easy expansion and modification of the database schema as the application evolves.

Github:
A clear and descriptive Git commit history will be maintained throughout the development process. Each commit will have a meaningful message explaining the changes made. Proper branching and merging strategies will be employed to manage features, bug fixes, and other development tasks effectively.

Use of Migrations:
Database migrations will be implemented to handle schema changes effectively. Migrations provide a structured way to modify the database schema without losing existing data, ensuring that the database schema stays in sync with the evolving requirements of the application.

Note: Please update this README file with specific instructions, installation guides, and other relevant information as the project progresses. Keeping the documentation up-to-date is crucial for developers, collaborators, and users to understand and contribute to the project effectively.
